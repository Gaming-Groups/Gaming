            <h1>About the game</h1>
            <p>Starfield for PC is an action role-playing game from the makers of the ridiculously successful Skyrim and
               Fallout 4, and it can be played from either first- or third- person perspectives. According to the game developers,
                they are hoping that this is the start of a huge franchise, similar to the two series mentioned above. As this is
                 the first new game in 25 years (since the above games first came out), expectations and hopes are sky high.
            </p>
            <p>The game is set 300 years in the future, when regular space exploration is not only happening, but it has also become
               very normalised. You are a member of Constellation, which is an organisation of space explorers – the last organisation
                of space explorers, in fact. Don’t waste time wondering what happened to all the other explorers and why they’re reduced
                 to one group, get on with the game!
            </p>
            <p>Constellation ships have a vibe in which steam punk meets NASA perfectly. The developers have termed it ‘NASA-punk’ and
               it teams sleek futuristic perfection with nuts and bolts basics that looks inviting and homey without losing confidence
                that the ships will actually fly and keep you alive while you get where you are going!
            </p>
            <h2>The Nitty Gritty</h2>
            <p>The game features a procedurally generated world to keep the game size down, and it is the first games which uses game 
              studio Bethesda’s revamped Creation Engine, called Creation Engine 2. In this first serious outing for the platform, it is
               so well done that your mouth will water, for example, just looking at that delicious looking cheddar cheese and salami 
               sandwich (with red pickled onions, lettuce and Dijon mustard, in case you want to try it out).
            </p>
            <p>Weapons are solid and satisfying in the hand, (with an homage to the Master Chief if you know where to look) and the space
               ship boasts various gauges and systems to keep tabs on for the good of your health and the ship’s. These include oxygen and
                carbon dioxide monitors, your individual mission suggestions, and even the shopping list – you don’t want to run out of soothing
                 Tranquillitea now, do you? (That’s pronounced ‘tranquillity, by the way.)
            </p>
            <p>You will play over varying terrains, from metropolises, alien jungles, alien deserts – these complete with crablike aliens, of course,
               and a city on stilts over a sea-sized body of water. Each offers unique challenges for you in completing your missions, but also offers
                advantages too, if you know where to find them. You can wear different suits for the changing terrains.

            <h1>About the game</h1>
            <p>Naruto X Boruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections for PC is a turn-based action roleplaying fighting game featuring characters 
              from the immensely popular Naruto anime series and the seventh in the Ultimate Storm series. Because the game’s release coincided
              with the 20th anniversary of the original anime, it features content and storylines from all the previous Ninja Storm games along
              with a brand-new, original storyline.
            </p>
            <p>Naruto is the OG of the series, and Boruto is his son, and the protagonist of the newer stories and games: this game has the best
               of the old and the new, with a wealth of content from the older games and stories alongside a new Boruto-based storyline for you 
               to play through. As well as this, the game boasts a staggering 130 characters from the Naruto/ Boruto universe, all of which are playable.
            </p>
            <p>More than this, many of the characters interact with each other and if you combine the right set of characters, you can unlock new levels
               and interesting cut scenes. For example – playing with Naruto, Kushina, and Minato shows the entire family fighting together in a battle scene.
                This offers a great deal of replayability as you can try out all sorts of likely and unlikely combos to see who works best together – and who does not!
            </p>
            <h2>The Nitty Gritty</h2>
            <p>The game characters range from the 124 known characters to newcomers such as Asura Otsutsuki and Indra, and you can choose any of them to make up your team.
               You can also pick up to six abilities to deploy against your foes, and your characters can ‘awaken’ into a new form – Naruto’s nine-tailed fox is a particular
                treat – all of which are used in your attempt to finish the battle – successfully!
              The game offers easy to use controls, intuitive gameplay and multiple campaigns, all of which ensures, along with the endlessly customisable team combinations,
               that you will enjoy playing through, no matter if you are a die-hard fan of the series or a first timer seeing what all the hype is about..

            <h1>About the game</h1>
            <p>Cities: Skylines II for PC is a city building game, the sequel to the first game with the same name. The player is the developer
               of a plot of land on which they must create a city. Players can lay down roads, zoning, utilities, and city services to attract
                residents and businesses. You can also set city policies like taxes and edicts to influence how the city grows – and spend the
                 tax money on more expansion, better services and improved infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>Initially you are limited to nine tiles of building space but you can purchase additional tiles from city funds – the above-mentioned
               tax, amongst other earning. Nine tiles was the upper limit of the previous game (it was twenty-five in the remastered edition that was
              for consoles): this game allows the player ultimately to go up to a hefty 441 tiles.<br>
              This means that the new map for Cities Skylines 2 tops out at 159km2 which is the same size as the entire country of Liechtenstein, in Europe.
               Buildings can be taller than before, so even within that nine tile starting point, you can do more.
            </p>
            <p>You must create trade routes to feed your city and keep your residents happy – this is even more important than before as population controls 
              – previously set to around 65,000 people – have been done away with. Each map in the game has a preset climate that influences the way weather
               patterns form. The weather and the population are all set in day-night and annual cycles, so people’s productivity will increase and decrease
              with the time of year.<br>
              The cold winters bring snow and ice, with grey skies, while summer means flooding and extreme events like tornadoes. You must set up disaster
               response facilities and services within the city to cope with these annual events.
            </p>
            <h2>The Nitty Gritty</h2>
            <p>iThe game has vastly improved and expanded upon the city building system that fans enjoyed, while adding more to the transport and economic
               systems, boosted construction methods and now allows for much more precise customisation – and even some advanced modding capabilities too.
                See below for some of the improvements in detail.
